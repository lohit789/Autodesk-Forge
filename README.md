Recreate the Documentation landing page as shown in Appendix A using Reactjs with the following requirements: 
1.	Use React Router to create these pages: 
a.	/developer/documentation  (this is the landing page you’ll design) 
b.	/developer/en/api/dummy1/intro  (can be a simple page with a header) 
c.	/developer/en/api/dummy1/guide (can be a simple page with a header) 
d.	/developer/en/api/dummy1/reference (can be a simple page with a header) 
2.	Create a JSON file to contain the list of APIs (title, descriptions, links). 
3.	Create reusable “Card” component to display the icon, title, description and links of each API. 
4.	Use CSS to create a drop shadow on Card when hovered over. 
5.	Use AJAX call to load the json file (no. 3) and populate the API cards. 
6.	Create responsive layout for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile screens (define the resolutions). Desktop screen with 3 columns, Tablet screen with 2 columns, Mobile screen with 1 column. You are free to use 3rd party open source library such as Bootstrap for their grid system. 
7.	Create a script to build the bundle. 
8.	Create a script to run a server and serve the page on your machine. 
9.	Take a screenshot of your final design in case the bundle fails to run on the day of interview. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
